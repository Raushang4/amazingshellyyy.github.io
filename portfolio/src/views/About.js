            <p style={{ paddingTop: "20px" }}>
                I learned my first programming language -- Java in 2014. During my bachelor in Taiwan, I was very much into UI/UX and frontend Designing. Therefore, I took several online courses to lay my fundamental in website design and HTML/CSS.
</p>
            <p>
                After I obtained my master in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I worked as a project manager at <a href="#0">InstaHub</a> which is a IoT start up at Philly. At InstaHub, I led the engineer team and UI/UX team on developing company website, data dashboard and Andriod/IOS Apps. I love to see the big picture and break it down into executable pieces. I enjoy working with cross-functional team and by leveraging my knowledge in business and technology, I ensure the direction and the quality of project handsoffs.
</p>
            <p>
                However, I found myself still lack of enough experience in the engineering side to fully lead the team. Also, when building a start up, I realized that, to me, the ability to build real product that people use is far more important than drawing a dreamy picture in business pitches. At the end of 2019, I decided to fully devote myself to an intense journey of becoming a Software Engineer.
